## Objective

To equip with the skills and methodologies necessary for investigating ransomware attacks using Splunk, focusing on identifying indicators of compromise (IOCs), analyzing PowerShell commands, and understanding ransomware behavior.

### Skills Learned

- Skills Learned
  - Log Analysis: Efficient use of Splunk to sift through logs and identify malicious activities.
  - Incident Response: Understanding the steps for responding to ransomware attacks, including timeline filtering and IOC identification.
  - PowerShell Command Decoding: Analyzing PowerShell commands to track malicious activities.
  - Malware Analysis: Understanding ransomware behavior, including encryption patterns and ransom notes.
  - Critical Thinking: Developing a methodical approach to analyzing evidence and correlating events for a comprehensive investigation.
  
### Tools Used

- Splunk: For log analysis and timeline filtering.
- CyberChef: For decoding and analyzing data.
- VirusTotal: For checking malicious file hashes and binaries.
- Sysmon: To monitor system activities and detect unauthorized downloads or command executions.
